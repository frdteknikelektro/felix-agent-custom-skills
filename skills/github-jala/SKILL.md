# GitHub Jala Management

## Purpose

Operate Jala's GitHub account (user `jalaproduct`, org `Atnic`) through the `gh` CLI. This skill extends the base `github` skill. Every operation, permission policy, destructive-operation gate, CLI availability check, and command reference is identical — read [../github/SKILL.md](../github/SKILL.md) for the full reference. This skill only overrides the credential contract and the default organization context.

**Default org**: All Jala repositories live under the `Atnic` GitHub organization. When no specific owner is provided, default to `Atnic`. For repo-scoped operations, use `--repo Atnic/<repo-name>`. To list all Jala repos, use `gh repo list Atnic`.

Do not duplicate operation documentation. If you need the full command reference for a GitHub operation, read the base `github` SKILL.md. This file documents only what is different.

## When to use

Activate when the user asks to interact with Jala's specific GitHub account (Atnic org, jalaproduct user). Trigger words include "jala github", "atnic", "jala repo", "jala issue", "jala pr", etc.

## Out of scope

- Non-Jala GitHub accounts or repositories — route to the base `github` skill
- Operations not covered by GitHub CLI/API

## Use cases

- **List Jala repos**: user asks "what repos does Jala have" → `gh repo list Atnic`
- **Create Jala issue**: user asks "file a bug in jala-web-next" → `gh issue create --repo Atnic/jala-web-next ...`
- **Review Jala PR**: user asks "review PR on atnic/core" → `gh pr review <number> --repo Atnic/<repo>`
- **Trigger Jala workflow**: user asks "deploy jala-api" → `gh workflow run deploy.yml --repo Atnic/<repo>`

## Permissions

Same text-based read/write split as the base `github` skill. Request the bare permission shown below; Felix stores grants under this skill id.

- `github.read` — inspection, listing, viewing, searching, downloading (same scope as base).
- `github.review` — adding comments, approving pull requests, merging pull requests, and other collaborative review actions (same scope as base).
- `github.write` — create, edit, close, reopen, fork, archive, rename, delete, rerun, cancel, set (same scope as base).

If an operation is ambiguous, treat it as `github.write` unless the user is only asking to inspect or explain current state.

Destructive operations are allowed only when the user explicitly asks — same gating as the base skill.

## Workflow

**Resolve permissions FIRST.** Before doing anything else — before checking CLI availability, before running any command — resolve permissions. If permission is missing, emit PERMISSION_REQUIRED. Never skip this. The only gate in this skill is the permission gate.

## Environment (overrides base)

Tokens are in the environment. The Jala account uses its own token:

- `GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN` — Jala-specific GitHub personal access token

Command pattern:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"
```

Verify:

```bash
test -n "$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN" &&
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN" &&
gh auth status
```

Note: the `gh` CLI reads `GITHUB_TOKEN` (and falls back to `GH_TOKEN`). The Jala value is mapped in: `GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"`. Never print the token value.

## CLI Not Found

If a `gh` command fails because the binary is missing, report it as a runtime error. Say: "The `gh` CLI is not installed. Use `install-tool` to install it, then retry." Do not pre-emptively check for the CLI.

## Operations

All operations are identical to the base `github` skill. Read [../github/SKILL.md](../github/SKILL.md) for the full operation reference covering Repositories, Issues, Pull Requests, Releases, Actions/Workflows, Secrets & Variables, Gists, Search, and API Access.

Every command must be preceded by using `GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"`.

For local operations (clone, edit, PRs), use the project workspace directory (`workspace/projects/<owner>/<repo>/`) exactly as documented in the base github skill. Always `cd` into the repo directory before running git or repo-local gh commands.

## Quick Examples
Every example maps `GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN` to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### List Jala repositories
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"
gh auth status
gh repo list Atnic --limit 50
```

### View a Jala repository
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"
gh auth status
gh repo view Atnic/jala-web-next --json name,description,url,defaultBranchRef
```

### Create a Jala repository
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"
gh auth status
gh repo create Atnic/new-service --private --description "New Jala microservice"
```

### List Jala issues
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"
gh auth status
gh issue list --repo Atnic/jala-web-next --state open --limit 20
```

### Create a Jala pull request
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"
gh auth status
gh pr create --repo Atnic/jala-web-next --title "Fix API timeout" --body "Increases timeout to 30s" --base main --head fix-timeout
```

### Set a Jala repository secret
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"
gh auth status
gh secret set DATABASE_URL --repo Atnic/jala-web-next --body "<secret-value>"
```

### Create a Jala release
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"
gh auth status
gh release create v1.2.0 --repo Atnic/jala-web-next --title "v1.2.0" --generate-notes
```

## Output

Same as base `github` skill. Keep replies concise and operational. Include repo name, issue/PR number, release tag, workflow name, and relevant identifiers. Never print the `GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN` value, secret values, or full signed request material.

## Checks

- Always export `GITHUB_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN"` before any GitHub command.
- Always verify the token with `gh auth status` before doing real work.
- Never print `GITHUB_JALA_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or any secret values.
- Read [../github/SKILL.md](../github/SKILL.md) for any operation not documented here.
- If the `gh` CLI binary is missing, tell the user to use `install-tool` first.
- Destructive operations must be explicitly requested by the user before proceeding.
- Tokens are in the environment.
