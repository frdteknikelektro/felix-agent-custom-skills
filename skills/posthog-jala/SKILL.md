# PostHog Jala Management

## Purpose

Operate Jala's PostHog analytics through the REST API. This skill extends the base `posthog` skill. Every operation, permission policy, destructive-operation gate, and API pattern is identical — read `skills/posthog/SKILL.md` for the full reference. This skill only overrides the credential contract, the Jala organization/project context, and qualified match rules.

**Jala organizations**:
- **Jala** — org ID `10590`
- **Jala Widget** — org ID `28053`

The Jala personal key (`POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY`) has access to both organizations. Detailed project listings are in `references/jala-context.md`.

Do not duplicate operation documentation. If you need the full operation reference for a PostHog operation, read the base `posthog` SKILL.md. This file documents only what is different.

## When to use

Activate when the user asks to query PostHog specifically for Jala's organization (orgs 10590 or 28053). Trigger words include "posthog jala", "jala analytics", "jala event", "jala feature flag", "jala dashboard".

## Out of scope

- Non-Jala PostHog organizations or projects — route to the base `posthog` skill
- Operations not covered by the PostHog REST API

## Use cases

- **Query Jala events**: user asks "show me Jala pageviews yesterday" → list Jala projects, then query events for that project
- **Create Jala feature flag**: user asks "create a flag for Jala checkout" → `POST /api/projects/{id}/feature_flags/`
- **List Jala dashboards**: user asks "what dashboards exist for Jala" → `GET /api/projects/{id}/dashboards/`
- **Run HogQL on Jala data**: user asks "top Jala events this week" → `POST /api/projects/{id}/query/`

## Permissions

Same text-based read/write split as the base `posthog` skill, namespaced under `posthog-jala`:

- `posthog-jala:posthog.read` — inspection, listing, viewing, searching, querying, downloads (same scope as base).
- `posthog-jala:posthog.write` — create, update, delete, toggle, launch, patch (same scope as base).

If an operation is ambiguous, treat it as `posthog-jala:posthog.write` unless the user is only asking to inspect or explain current state.

Destructive operations are allowed only when the user explicitly asks — same gating as the base skill.

## Workflow

**Resolve permissions FIRST.** Before doing anything else — before running any API call — resolve permissions. If permission is missing, emit PERMISSION_REQUIRED. Never skip this. The only gate in this skill is the permission gate.

## Environment (overrides base)

Tokens are already in the environment. The Jala org uses its own API keys:

- `POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY` — Jala-specific private API key for management CRUD (prefix `phx_`)
- `POSTHOG_JALA_PROJECT_KEY` — Jala-specific project key (only for capture endpoints, optional)

Credential mapping pattern:

```bash
export POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY="$POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY"
test -n "$POSTHOG_JALA_PROJECT_KEY" && export POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY="$POSTHOG_JALA_PROJECT_KEY"
```

Verify the Jala key before any work:

```bash
test -n "$POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY" &&
export POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY="$POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY" &&
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY" \
  "https://app.posthog.com/api/users/@me/"
```

Note: the base `posthog` skill reads `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY` from the environment. The Jala value is mapped in: `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY="$POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY"`. Never print the key value.

## Jala Organization & Project Context

When the user does not specify which organization or project, default to the Jala orgs:

1. **List Jala projects**: Query projects from both orgs:
   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY" \
     "https://app.posthog.com/api/organizations/10590/projects/"
   ```
   and
   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY" \
     "https://app.posthog.com/api/organizations/28053/projects/"
   ```

2. **If the user names a project**, match by name across both orgs. If there's ambiguity (same name in both orgs), list both and ask which one.

3. **Fall back** to `GET /api/projects/` for the full list if the org-scoped listing is insufficient.

4. **Consult `references/jala-context.md`** for known project IDs and naming conventions. This file is best-effort — if a project ID returns 404, re-list projects via API to get the current state.

5. Once `project_id` is confirmed, cache it for the current session (do not re-ask).

When listing projects, include the org name so the user can disambiguate between Jala and Jala Widget.

## Operations

All operations are identical to the base `posthog` skill. Read `skills/posthog/SKILL.md` for the full operation reference covering Events, Feature Flags, Insights, Dashboards, Persons, Cohorts, Annotations, Surveys, Experiments, Session Recordings, HogQL Queries, Schema & Taxonomy, and Groups.

Every `curl` command must map `POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY` → `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY`.

## Quick Examples
Every example maps `POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY` to `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY`.

### Verify Jala auth
```bash
export POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY="$POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY"
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY" \
  "https://app.posthog.com/api/users/@me/"
```

### List Jala projects across both orgs
```bash
export POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY="$POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY"
echo "=== Jala (10590) ==="
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY" \
  "https://app.posthog.com/api/organizations/10590/projects/" | python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(f'  {p[\"id\"]:>6}  {p[\"name\"]}') for p in json.load(sys.stdin).get('results',[])]"
echo "=== Jala Widget (28053) ==="
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY" \
  "https://app.posthog.com/api/organizations/28053/projects/" | python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(f'  {p[\"id\"]:>6}  {p[\"name\"]}') for p in json.load(sys.stdin).get('results',[])]"
```

### Query Jala events from yesterday
```bash
export POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY="$POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY"
curl -s -G \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode 'after=-1d' \
  --data-urlencode 'limit=10' \
  "https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/{project_id}/events/"
```

### List Jala feature flags
```bash
export POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY="$POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY"
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY" \
  "https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/{project_id}/feature_flags/" | python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(f'{f[\"id\"]:>6}  {f[\"key\"]:<35}  active={f[\"active\"]}') for f in json.load(sys.stdin).get('results',[])]"
```

### Create Jala feature flag
```bash
export POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY="$POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY"
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key":"new_feature","name":"New Feature","active":false,"filters":{"groups":[{"properties":[],"rollout_percentage":0}]}}' \
  "https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/{project_id}/feature_flags/"
```

### Query Jala events with time range
```bash
export POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY="$POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY"
curl -s -G \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode 'after=2024-06-01T00:00:00Z' \
  --data-urlencode 'before=2024-06-02T00:00:00Z' \
  --data-urlencode 'event=$pageview' \
  --data-urlencode 'limit=50' \
  "https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/{project_id}/events/"
```

## Output

Same as base `posthog` skill. Keep replies concise and operational. Include project name, ID, and relevant counts. Never print `POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY`, `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY`, or any credential value.

## Checks

- Always map `POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY` → `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_KEY` before any API call.
- Always verify the key with `GET /api/users/@me/` before doing real work.
- Never print `POSTHOG_JALA_PERSONAL_KEY` or any credential value.
- For project-scoped operations, default to Jala orgs (10590, 28053) when the user doesn't specify.
- Read `skills/posthog/SKILL.md` for any operation not documented here.
- Read `references/jala-context.md` for Jala org/project details — but verify with API if a reference ID returns 404.
- Destructive operations must be explicitly requested by the user before proceeding.
- Tokens are in the environment.
